# Add Interactive Animations to React Apps with Framer Motion Course

Welcome to my course! In this course you'll learn how to add interactive animations to a React application with [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/). If you want to dive in and get started here's a link to the repo for the existing application.


## What is Framer Motion?

Framer Motion is production ready library for creating animation declaritativly in React applicaltions. 

You tell Framer what element you want to animate by adding the `animate` prop

```jsx
 
<motion.div animate={{ }}>

</motion.div>
```
 
It also has smart defaults that will make your animations look good.

## What will you need to know before the course?

I would recommend you at a beginnger level understanding of React.

  - Function Components
  - Props
  - Destructing
  - Hooks
  - React useState

If you don't have that I would recommended taking Kent C. Dodds free [Beginner's Guide to React](https://egghead.io/courses/the-beginner-s-guide-to-react)

You should be able to follow along with my [5 min mini course](https://egghead.io/lessons/react-up-running-with-framer-motion) on Framer Motion



## What will you be learning?

You will have an existing shopping list application. You install Framer Motion and and start add animations to the the shopping list. You'll learn how to animate between states, add hover animations, share animations between components, extract animations into objects to be re-useable.



## Who Am I?

Hi I'm Will. I'm a self-taught developer working at egghead.io who enjoys making websites look good!. Animating web apps is something I've emjoyed since I began learning. When I discovered Framer Motion I fell in love because it made adding animations to React app easy and staight forward without being a expert at CSS or animations.
